Cells consist of various parts: the cell wall (structure and protection), cell membrane (regulates entry/exit), cytoplasm (holds organelles), nucleus (genetic info), vacuoles (storage), chloroplasts (photosynthesis), ER (protein/lipid production), Golgi body (protein packaging), mitochondria (energy), and ribosomes (protein synthesis).
The protoplasm of a cell is composed of the cell membrane, cytoplasm, and nucleus.
The Golgi body chemically modifies substances from the ER, stores them, and packages them in vesicles for secretion out of the cell. It plays a crucial role in processing and transporting cellular materials.
Plant cells have a cell wall, chloroplasts for photosynthesis, and a large central vacuole, while animal cells lack these features and have many small vacuoles. These differences impact their structural support and nutrient storage functions.
Two key differences visible under a light microscope are: (a) plant cells have a cell wall and chloroplasts, whereas animal cells do not. (b) Plant cells possess a large central vacuole, unlike animal cells, which have smaller vacuoles.
Different cell types have varied shapes and structures tailored to their specific functions. For example, red blood cells are biconcave to enhance oxygen transport, while root hair cells are elongated to increase water absorption.
Plant tissue culture can enhance the environment and life in less developed countries by rapidly producing disease-resistant plant varieties, improving crop yields, and aiding large-scale reforestation efforts. This boosts food security and supports ecological sustainability.
Red blood cells deliver oxygen efficiently by lacking a nucleus, containing hemoglobin, having a biconcave shape to maximize surface area for diffusion, and being flexible to navigate narrow capillaries, ensuring optimal oxygen transport throughout the body.
The cell membrane regulates the movement of substances in and out of the cell by being selectively permeable. It allows some substances to pass while restricting others, maintaining homeostasis within the cell.
Diffusion is the movement of particles from high to low concentration across a permeable membrane. In plants and humans, the rate of diffusion is affected by concentration gradient, diffusion distance, surface area-to-volume ratio, and membrane permeability.
Diffusion is crucial for living organisms as it enables the movement of gases and nutrients across membranes, maintaining essential concentration gradients. This process supports cellular functions by facilitating efficient exchanges necessary for survival and maintaining internal homeostasis.
Cells are typically small because a higher surface area-to-volume ratio improves the efficiency of material movement across the cell membrane, which is crucial for sustaining cellular functions and survival. Larger cells face slower diffusion rates, limiting their size.
Root hair cells and epithelial cells in the small intestine are adapted for absorption by having long protrusions or folds, which increase their surface area-to-volume ratio. This adaptation enhances their efficiency in absorbing water, mineral salts, and nutrients.
Osmosis is the diffusion of water through a partially permeable membrane from an area of higher to lower water potential. In plant tissues, it causes cells to become turgid or plasmolysed, while in animal tissues, it may cause swelling or dehydration.
NEWater is crucial for Singapore as it provides up to 40% of its water needs by recycling treated water into ultra-clean, high-grade reclaimed water through reverse osmosis, ensuring a sustainable, reliable, and less import-dependent water supply.
Turgor is crucial for plant structure as it maintains cell rigidity by pressing the cell membrane against the cell wall. This pressure supports plant tissues and prevents wilting, influencing the shape and firmness of plant parts.
To show osmosis in living tissues using a potato strip, refer to Experiment 2C in the Practical Workbook. The procedure involves placing potato strips in water and sucrose solutions, observing changes in strip length due to osmotic effects.
Energy is essential for active transport because it allows substances to move against a concentration gradient, from areas of lower to higher concentration. This process is vital for various cellular functions, including nutrient uptake and ion regulation.

Marathon runners eat a lot of carbohydrates before a race because they provide essential energy needed for peak performance. Although excessive sugary foods can cause obesity, carbohydrates are crucial for fueling endurance and maintaining energy during the race.
