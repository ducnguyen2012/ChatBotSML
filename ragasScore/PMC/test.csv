What tests can be performed to identify different nutrients in food?,"To test a food for presence of reducing sugars or proteins, you can cut the food into small pieces or grind up the food with a pestle and mortar. This helps to break the cells and release the food substances so as to make a concentrated solution for testing. You then place some crushed pieces of food in a test-tube, add water to the test-tube to dissolve the sugars and proteins in the food, decant the solution into another test-tube, and perform Benedict’s or biuret test with the solution. To test for starch, you can use the iodine test. To test for fats, you can use the ethanol emulsion test.","Document 26: Chapter 3 Cells and the Chemistry of Life Now, look at Figure 3.27.

They help their clients to incorporate healthy eating behaviours into their lifestyle. To be successful at this, nutrition coaches need to have a good knowledge of what nutrients can do for our health. They must have a good understanding of human behaviour, especially when people are faced with changes in life. They can incorporate healthy diets into the programmes to build the physical fitness of their clients.Cool CareerFigure 3.26 Nutrition coach and a patient discussing a diet plan  54pestle mortar Fats are bad for usand we should not eatany food that contains fats.In order to obtainenough protein in our diet, we should eat more meat instead of plant-based foods.Since the role ofcarbohydrates is to release energy for our body to function, they are the most important type of nutrient.Figure 3.27 Three friends are having a discussion about nutrients.

What is the optimum pH for the activity of protease in the stomach?,The optimum pH for the activity of protease in the stomach is pH 2.,"Document 33: 68 Chapter 4 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeEnzymesChapter 4 Practical WorkbookExperiments 4A–4B Link Enzymes Are Affected by pHEnzymes are affected by the acidity or alkalinity of the solutions in which they act. Some work best in acidic solutions (for example, protease in the stomach), others require alkaline solutions (for example, intestinal enzymes). When enzymes are placed in pH conditions that vary from the optimum, they start to denature. Extreme changes in the acidity or alkalinity of the solutions denature the enzymes. In Figure 4.13, point Mindicates maximum activity of amylase at a pH of about 7 (optimum pH). As the solution becomes acidic (from pH 7 to 5) or alkaline (from pH 7 to 9), its activity decreases. At pH 4 or above pH 9, the enzyme is completely denatured.Structure and FunctionEnzymes are proteins, and hence are affected by all the conditions that affect proteins, such as temperature and pH. They have optimal ranges of temperature and pH.Disciplinary Idea Helpful Note Optimum pH values of some enzymes:• amylase (a carbohydrase) in saliva: pH 7 • protease in stomach: pH 2 • protease in small intestine: pH 8 Figure 4.13 Effect of pH on the rate of reactions catalysed by different enzymes Figure 4.12Experimental set-up to show how temperature affects enzyme action Conclusion1 The less time taken to digest starch, the more active the enzyme is.

In some instances, the vaccines need to be stored at temperatures as low as –70 °C. At this very low temperature, enzymatic reactions that could break down the mRNA (a type of genetic material) in the vaccine are literally frozen to a halt. Scientists and engineers thus need to design, construct and use special freezers that have the ability to maintain such sub-arctic temperatures. They also need to design and construct containers that can store and transport large quantities of the vaccines across the world, from the place where it is manufactured to reach different countries.These special freezers and containers are examples of technology in action. Engineers apply their knowledge in cooling systems to design and build machines that work to prevent enzymatic reactions on the vaccine ingredients during storage and transport (Figure 4.14).

Document 32: 66 Chapter 4 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeEnzymesChapter 4 Characteristics of EnzymesEnzymes Speed Up Chemical ReactionsEnzymes alter the rates of chemical reactions that occur in a cell. Enzymes speed up a chemical reaction by lowering the activation energy needed to start the reaction.Enzymes Are Specific in Action Enzymes have active sites. Only substrates with a shape complementary to the active site can fit into the enzymes. When an enzyme binds to its substrate, it forms an enzyme–substrate complex. However, high temperature, acids and alkalis can affect the shape of an enzyme and consequently its function.Enzymes Are Required in Minute Amounts and RemainUnchanged at the End of ReactionsEnzymes are very efficient molecules. Since they remain unchanged in the reactions they catalyse, the same enzyme molecules can be used over and over again. Thus, a small amount of an enzyme can catalyse the reaction for a large amount of substrate. For example, just a spoonful of washing powder containing enzymes is enough to wash a large load of clothing. Enzymes Are Affected by TemperatureFigure 4.10 shows the effect of temperature on the rate of enzyme reaction. Figure 4.10 Effect of temperature on the rate of enzyme reaction  Word AlertOptimum:most favourable  An enzyme is less active at low temperatures.At low temperature, the kinetic energy of molecules is low. Enzyme and substrate molecules move slowly. The rate of the substrate molecules colliding with the enzyme is very low. 1As the temperature increases, the rate of enzyme reaction increases.Increasing the temperature increases the kinetic energy of molecules. The rate of effective collision (i.e. the rate of substrate molecules colliding and fitting into the active site of the enzyme) is increased. This increases the rate of enzyme-substrate complex formation. 2This is the optimum temperature, where the enzymeis most active. For most human enzymes, the optimumtemperature is about 40–45 °C. 367 Chapter 4 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeEnzymesChapter 4 Increasing the temperature above the optimum causes a rapid decrease in the rate of enzyme reaction. The active site of the enzyme molecule begins to lose its original shape and is no longer complementary to the shape of substrate molecules.  4At this temperature all the enzyme molecules have been denatured. Most enzymes are denatured. 5 Denaturation results in the loss or alteration of the enzyme’s active site(Figure 4.11). The substrate can no longer fit into the enzyme’s active site, and no reaction will occur. Hence, when an enzyme is denatured, it can no longer act as a catalyst. Denaturation is the change in the three-dimensional structure of an enzyme or any other soluble protein, caused by heat or chemicals such as acids or alkalis. Figure 4.11 At temperatures above optimum, some enzymes are denatured. Enzymes lose their active sites when they are denatured.

Document 1: 4 Chapter 1 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeCell Structure and OrganisationChapter 1 Figure 1.5 A generalised plant cell The protoplasm of a cell is made up of three parts: the cell membrane(also known as cell surface membrane), cytoplasmand nucleus(Figure 1.4). Cell MembraneThe cell membrane surrounds the cytoplasm of the cell. The cell membrane is made up of lipidsand proteins. It is a partially permeable membrane. This means that it allows only some substances to pass through it. Hence, the cell membrane controls the movement of substances in and out of the cell. Cell WallA plant cell also has a cell wallthat encloses the entire plant cell, surrounding the cell membrane (Figure 1.5). This cell wall is made of cellulose. It protects the cell from injury and gives the plant cell a fixed shape. The cell wall is fully permeable, so it does not control the type of substances that enter or leave the cell. The cell wall is absent in animal cells. Figure 1.4 A generalised animal cell showing some major organelles SystemsCells are highly organised biological systems with many organelles. While each organelle performs specific functions, the various organelles work as a co-ordinated system within the cell to carry out processes needed to sustain life. Disciplinary Idea Helpful Note The terms ‘cell surface membrane’ and ‘cell membrane’ are used in this book to refer to the membrane enclosing the entire cell. Organelles inside the cell are also enclosed by their own membranes. Word AlertMitochodrion:singular for mitochondriaLipids:biological molecules that are not soluble in water. Examples of lipids are fats, waxes and oils. 5 Chapter 1 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeCell Structure and OrganisationChapter 1 CytoplasmThe cytoplasm is a jelly-like substance that fills the inside of the cell and is enclosed by the cell membrane. It is the part of the protoplasm between the cell membrane and the nucleus. It is where most cell activities occur. The cytoplasm contains organelles. An organelleis a cellular structure that performs a specific job within a cell.Organelles carry out many functions in the cell. You will learn more about them in later parts of this chapter. Many organelles, such as mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi bodyand ribosomesare not visible under the light microscope. They can only be studied under the electron microscope. What Are the Parts of the Cytoplasm?The cytoplasm contains tiny structures called organelles (Figure 1.6). Each organelleis specialised for a particular function. Examples of these organelles are nucleus, rough endoplasmic reticulum, ribosomes, Golgi body, mitochondria, chloroplasts and vacuoles.  Figure 1.6 Organelles in an animal cell seen under an electron microscope NucleusThe nucleus is surrounded by a membrane called the nuclear membrane. The nucleus contains genetic information in the form of chromosomes. You will learn more about chromosomes later in this section. These are the functions of the nucleus:• It controls cell activities such as cell growth and the repair of worn-out parts.• It is essential for cell division. Cells without a nucleus, like the red blood cells of a mammal, are unable to divide.

(Greek: endoplasm= within the cytoplasm; reticulum= network).• Its surface appears rough when viewed under the electron microscope. This is because small particles called ribosomes are attached to its outer surface (Figure 1.10).• The outer surface of the RER is continuous with the nuclear membrane.

Document 33: 68 Chapter 4 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeEnzymesChapter 4 Practical WorkbookExperiments 4A–4B Link Enzymes Are Affected by pHEnzymes are affected by the acidity or alkalinity of the solutions in which they act. Some work best in acidic solutions (for example, protease in the stomach), others require alkaline solutions (for example, intestinal enzymes). When enzymes are placed in pH conditions that vary from the optimum, they start to denature. Extreme changes in the acidity or alkalinity of the solutions denature the enzymes. In Figure 4.13, point Mindicates maximum activity of amylase at a pH of about 7 (optimum pH). As the solution becomes acidic (from pH 7 to 5) or alkaline (from pH 7 to 9), its activity decreases. At pH 4 or above pH 9, the enzyme is completely denatured.Structure and FunctionEnzymes are proteins, and hence are affected by all the conditions that affect proteins, such as temperature and pH.

In some instances, the vaccines need to be stored at temperatures as low as –70 °C. At this very low temperature, enzymatic reactions that could break down the mRNA (a type of genetic material) in the vaccine are literally frozen to a halt. Scientists and engineers thus need to design, construct and use special freezers that have the ability to maintain such sub-arctic temperatures. They also need to design and construct containers that can store and transport large quantities of the vaccines across the world, from the place where it is manufactured to reach different countries.These special freezers and containers are examples of technology in action. Engineers apply their knowledge in cooling systems to design and build machines that work to prevent enzymatic reactions on the vaccine ingredients during storage and transport (Figure 4.14).

Document 28: 58 Chapter 4 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeEnzymesChapter 4 4.1 What Are Enzymes?Learning Outcome• Describe enzymes as biological catalysts, which are made of proteins and are involved in all metabolic reactions. Biological CatalystsBiological catalysts are large biological molecules called enzymes. Most enzymes are found in living organisms.For example, potassium chlorate(VII) naturally breaks down (decomposes) to water and oxygen. This reaction occurs very slowly and at a high temperature.potassium chlorate(VII) potassium chloride +oxygenWhen potassium chlorate(VII) is heated strongly in a test-tube, oxygen is given off. Gentle heating only melts the potassium chlorate(VII), and no oxygen is produced.If a little manganese(IV) oxide is added to the melted substance, the reaction is speeded up and oxygen is rapidly given off. Manganese(IV) oxide: • allows the reaction to be carried out at a lower temperature; and • speeds up the reaction. At the end of the reaction, the same mass of manganese(IV) oxide remains, showing that it has not been changed in the reaction. Manganese(IV) oxide is an inorganic catalyst(Figure 4.1). Inorganic catalysts are not destroyed by boilingor by changes in the pH of the solution. In the same way, complex apparatus and high temperatures are required to break down carbohydrates, fats or proteins in the laboratory. However, cells can carry out these same reactions quite rapidly without having to raise the body temperature. Cells carry out these reactions using catalysts called enzymes. Enzymes Are Biological Catalysts Enzymes are made up of protein molecules that are folded to take on three-dimensional globular shapes.strong heat A catalystis a substance that can speed up a chemical reaction, without itself being chemically changed at the end of the reaction. Enzymesare proteins that function as biological catalysts. They catalyse or speed up the rate of chemical reactions. They remain chemically unchanged at the end of the reaction.Figure 4.1 Manganese(IV) oxide is an inorganic catalyst. LinkWhat are proteins? Recall what you have learnt in Chapter 3. 59 Chapter 4 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeEnzymesChapter 4 Figure 4.3 Activation energy for an enzyme-catalysed reactionEnzymes Lower Activation Energy Fat in a peanut seed can be broken down by oxidation into carbon dioxide and water. This reaction can take place when the peanut is burnt. In other words, energy in the form of heat must be supplied to start breaking down the fat in the peanut seed. The energy needed to start a chemical reaction is called activation energy (Figure 4.2). Enzymes provide an alternative pathway with lower activation energy required to start a chemical reaction. They lower the ‘height’ of the ‘hill’. This is shown in the graph in Figure 4.3. Enzymes catalyse chemical reactions. They speed up the rate of chemical reactions by lowering the activation energy.For example, enzymes speed up the breakdown of glucose to carbon dioxide and water (Figure 4.3) at body temperature (37 °C).ChemistryWe learn the effects of catalysts on the rate of reactions. Catalysts provide pathways with lower activation energies that increase rate of reactions. Enzymes are biological catalysts.  Link activation energyman represents activation energy Activation energyis the energy needed to roll the stone up the hill. Once over the hill, the rest of the reaction occurs. The stone rolls down and breaks into tiny pieces (products are formed). 2Imagine achemical reaction as the process of rolling a huge stone (reactant) up a hill so that it rolls down and breaks into tiny pieces (products).  1EnergyEnzymes help to lower the activation energy required to break down large molecules into smaller molecules.Disciplinary Idea reactantproductsFigure 4.2 Activation energy is needed to start a chemical reaction. 1 2

Document 31: 64 Chapter 4 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeEnzymesChapter 4 An enzyme is specific in its action due to its three-dimensional shape. The ‘lock-and-key’ hypothesis explains how the shape of an enzyme affects the way it functions. ‘Lock-and-key’ Hypothesis The substances on which enzymes act are called substrates. For example, protein is the substrate on which a protease acts. According to the ‘lock-and-key’ hypothesis, enzyme reactions depend on the presence of active sites (Figure 4.8). Active sites are grooves (depressions) or ‘pockets’ on the surface of an enzyme molecule into which the substrate molecule(s) with the matching shape can fit — just like a lock and key. The enzyme is the lock, and the substrate is the key.  When the substrate binds to the active site of the enzyme, anenzyme–substrate complex is formed. It is a temporary molecule formed when substrates bind to the enzyme. Reactions take place at the active site to convert the substrate molecule(s) into product molecule(s). The product molecule(s) separate(s) from the enzyme. The enzyme molecule remains unchanged and is free to combine again with more substrate molecules. The general equation is: E + S ES E + P where E= enzymeS= substrate(s)P= product(s). Figure 4.8 Three-dimensional model of enzyme pepsin with its active siteactive site (groove on the protein)Structure and FunctionThe structure of biological molecules affects their functions. For example, the structure of enzymes affects the substrates that can fit into the active site. This affects the reactions they catalyse.Disciplinary Idea 65 Chapter 4 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeEnzymesChapter 4 Word AlertComplementary:matching An enzyme has a specific three-dimensional (3-D) shape. It has a depression called the active site. The substance on which the enzyme acts is called the substrate. Later, the products leave the active site. The enzyme remains unchanged. It can catalyse another reaction.While the substrate is attached to the active site, a chemical reaction occurs. The substrate is converted to the products.Only the substrate with a 3-D shape complementaryto that of the active site can fit into the enzyme. This results in the formation of an enzyme–substrate complex. The enzyme is just like a lock and the substrate a key. The substrate fits into the enzyme just like a key fits into a lock. This is called the ‘lock-and-key’ hypothesis. 1 3 4  Figure 4.9 The mode of action of an enzyme The specific nature of an enzyme for its substrate is described in Figure 4.9. 2 Substrate entering active site of enzyme Substrate binds to active site of enzyme Chemical reaction occurs while substrate is attached to the enzyme Products leaving active site of enzyme",[],"{'question_type': 'complex', 'seed_document_id': 32, 'topic': 'Cellular Biochemistry and Enzymes'}"
What is the term for the phenomenon where water molecules traverse from an area of higher water potential to an area of lower water potential via a semi-permeable membrane?,The process is called osmosis.,"Document 14: 30 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 How Does Osmosis Affect Living Organisms?A cell is surrounded by a living, partially permeable cell membrane. Enclosed within the cell membrane are the nucleus, cytoplasm and a mixture of various substances.Note that the cell wall of plants is permeable and allows most dissolved substances to pass through. A plant cell behaves differently from an animal cell when placed in solutions with differing water potentials. This is due to the presence of the cell wall in plant cells.TechConnectIn Singapore, there are five NEWater plants that supply Singapore with up to 40% of its water needs. The NEWater process involves recycling treated used water into ultra-clean, high-grade reclaimed water. One of the stages of the NEWater production process is reverse osmosis. Similar to osmosis, this process involves a partially permeable membrane. However, pressure is applied to move water molecules across the membrane in a direction that is opposite to that of osmosis.Reverse osmosis can remove toxins from water. By this method, very small particles can be removed by using an electric pump to force water under high pressure through a membrane (Figure 2.19). The membrane is partially permeable and has very tiny pores, which allow only very small molecules such as water molecules to pass through. The water is passed through the membrane several times until pure water is obtained.Why do you think NEWater is an important source of water for Singapore? Figure 2.19 Reverse osmosis water treatment systemFigure 2.18 represents graphically how water potential is associated with osmosis. Figure 2.18 Graphical representation of water potential gradient Osmosisis the net movement of water molecules from a region of higher water potential to a region of lower water potential, through a partially permeable membrane. Similar to diffusion, the rate of osmosis can be affected by factors such as:• water potential gradient • distance over which water molecules need to move • surface area-to-volume ratio 31 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 What Happens to a Cell in a Solution With Higher Water Potential? When a cell is placed in a solution with a higher water potential, water molecules will move from a region of higher water potential (outside the cell), into a region of lower water potential (inside the cell).A plant cell will expand or swell. This is because plant cells are protected by an inelastic cell wall (Figure 2.20). Plants are supported by the pressure of water inside the cells pressing outwards on the cell wall. An animal cell will swell and may even burst in a solution of higher water potential than its cytoplasm (Figure 2.21). This is because, unlike plants, it does not have a cell wall to protect it. What Happens to a Cell in a Solution of the Same Water Potential?Cells immersed in a solution with the same water potential as their cytoplasm will not change their size or shape. The movement of water molecules is the same in both directions. Hence, there is no net movement of water molecules in or out of the cell.Figure 2.20 A plant cell in a solution with higher water potential Figure 2.21 An animal cell in a solution with higher water potentialHomeostasis, Co-ordination and ResponseThrough the processes of diffusion, osmosis and active transport, the internal environments of living organisms are kept constant to provide the optimal conditions for cells to survive.Disciplinary Idea placed in a solution of higher water potentialAs water molecules enter the cell, the vacuole increases in size and pushes the cytoplasm against the cell wall. The cell does not burst because it is protected by the inelastic cell wall. The turgidity of the cell with water is called turgor. The pressure exerted by the water in the vacuole is the turgor pressure. 4 The cell expands or swells. The cell is said to become turgid. 3 When a plant cell is placed in a solution of higher water potential, the cell sap has lower water potential than that of the solution outside the cell. 1plant cell cell sap in vacuole By osmosis, water molecules enter the cell through the partially permeable cell membrane. 2LinkHuman cells must be surrounded by fluid in relatively constant water potential. Read more about how this is done in Chapter 9.

Document 15: 32 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 What Happens to a Cell in a Solution With Lower Water Potential?When a cell is placed in a solution with a lower water potential, water molecules will move from a region of higher water potential (inside the cell), into a region of lower water potential (outside the cell).A plant cell will decrease in size and become limp (Figure 2.22). Placing an animal cell in a solution with lower water potential will cause it to lose water. The cell shrinks and spikes appear on the cell (Figure 2.23). This process is called crenation. An animal cell will become dehydrated and eventually die when placed in a solution with a low water potential. Figure 2.22 A plant cell in a solution with lower water potential Figure 2.23 An animal cell in a solution with lower water potential By osmosis, water molecules from the vacuole and cytoplasm leave the cell through the partially permeable cell membrane. 2 placed in a solution of lower water potential As the cell loses water, the vacuole decreases in size. The cytoplasm shrinks away from the cell wall. The shrinkage of cytoplasm and cell membrane away from the cell wall is called plasmolysis. The cell is said to be plasmolysed. A plasmolysed cell can be restored to its original state by placing it in water or in a solution with higher water potential. 4 The cell decreases in size and becomes flaccid or limp. 3 When a plant cell is immersed in a solution with lower water potential, the cell sap has a higher water potential than the solution outside the cell. 1plant cell cell sap in vacuole 33 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 Figure 2.25 Cells of onion leaf epidermis (stained)Figure 2.24 Electron micrograph of stomata Figure 2.26 Effects of turgor pressure on plants Why Is Turgor Important in Plants?Turgor, or how turgid cells are, plays an important role in maintaining the shape of soft tissues in plants. The young stems and leaves of herbaceous and non-woody plants are able to remain firm and erect. This is because of the turgor pressure within their cells. When there is a high rate of water loss from the cells, they lose their turgidity and the plant wilts. The movements of certain plant parts are due to changes in turgor. For example, changes in the turgor of the guard cells cause the opening and closing of the stomata (Figure 2.24). Plasmolysis causes cells to become flaccid or limp (Figure 2.25). Cells will be killed if they remain plasmolysed for too long. Thus, it is not advisable to add too much fertiliser around the roots of plants because the soil solution will become very concentrated and water molecules will move out of the roots by osmosis. Inability of the roots to absorb water, together with continued evaporation of water from the leaves, will cause the plant to wilt. Unless sufficient water is added to dilute the soil solution, the plant will eventually die (Figure 2.26).Helpful Note Soil solution is a thin film of water that surrounds individual soil particles. It usually contains dissolved mineral salts or ions.

Document 13: 28 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 ChemistryWe learn that the concentration of a solution is given by the amount of a solute dissolved in a unit volume of the solution. Link Compared to arm B, arm A contains: • More sucrose molecules per unit volume• Fewer water molecules per unit volumeAfter some time, the level of solution in arm A rises, while that in arm B falls.What do you think has happened?• Sucrose molecules cannot diffuse from arm A to B because the molecules are too big to pass through the pores of the membrane. • Water molecules move from B to A because solution B has more water molecules per unit volume than solution A. A dilute solution has more water molecules per unit volume than a concentrated solution of the same volume.Net result: Both arms A and B have the same solute concentration (same number of solute molecules per unit volume).The diffusion of water molecules across a partially permeable membrane is called osmosis. 2.2 What Is Osmosis?Learning Outcomes• Define osmosis, investigate and describe the effects of osmosis on plant and animal tissues.• Discuss the factors that affect the rate of osmosis. Figure 2.15 Experimental set-up to demonstrate osmosis OsmosisThe cell membrane is a partially permeable membrane. It allows some substances to pass through but not others. Figure 2.15 shows the two arms of a U-tube separated by a partially permeable membrane. This membrane is permeable to water molecules but not to sucrose molecules. Sucrose is cane sugar, also known as table sugar. 29 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 Figure 2.17 Water potential gradient set up in the container AimTo demonstrate osmosisProcedure1Tie a knot at one end of a piece of dialysis tubing.2Half-fill a boiling tube with distilled water.3Use a pipette to half-fill the dialysis tubing with sucrose solution.

Make sure the levels of the liquid inside and outside the tubing are the same. Use a paper clip to hold the dialysis tubing in place. Mark the level on the outside of the boiling tube.5Set up a second experiment in a similar way but with distilled water in both the dialysis tubing and the boiling tube. 6After 20 minutes, observe and note the level of liquid inside and outside the tubing in each experiment. Observation and Discussion1What can you say about the dialysis tubing? How do you account for your observation in step 6?2What is the purpose of the second experimental set-up? Let’s Investigate 2.4 What Is Water Potential and How Is It Related to Osmosis?• The term ‘water potential’ is always used in connection with osmosis. Water potential is a measure of the tendency of water molecules to move from one place to another. A dilute solution (solution with lower concentration of solute) would have a higher water potential than a concentrated solution. Hence, water molecules would move out of the dilute solution and into the concentrated solution through osmosis.• When a partially permeable membrane separates two solutions of different water potentials, a water potential gradient is established (Figure 2.17). Water molecules move from a region with higher water potential to a region with a lower one, that is, down a water potential gradient.

Cell MembraneThe cell membrane surrounds the cytoplasm of the cell. The cell membrane is made up of lipidsand proteins. It is a partially permeable membrane. This means that it allows only some substances to pass through it. Hence, the cell membrane controls the movement of substances in and out of the cell. Cell WallA plant cell also has a cell wallthat encloses the entire plant cell, surrounding the cell membrane (Figure 1.5). This cell wall is made of cellulose. It protects the cell from injury and gives the plant cell a fixed shape. The cell wall is fully permeable, so it does not control the type of substances that enter or leave the cell. The cell wall is absent in animal cells. Figure 1.4 A generalised animal cell showing some major organelles SystemsCells are highly organised biological systems with many organelles. While each organelle performs specific functions, the various organelles work as a co-ordinated system within the cell to carry out processes needed to sustain life.

It is the part of the protoplasm between the cell membrane and the nucleus. It is where most cell activities occur. The cytoplasm contains organelles. An organelleis a cellular structure that performs a specific job within a cell.Organelles carry out many functions in the cell. You will learn more about them in later parts of this chapter. Many organelles, such as mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi bodyand ribosomesare not visible under the light microscope. They can only be studied under the electron microscope. What Are the Parts of the Cytoplasm?The cytoplasm contains tiny structures called organelles (Figure 1.6). Each organelleis specialised for a particular function.

Document 0: 2 Chapter 1 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeCell Structure and OrganisationChapter 1 Imagining Cells as Chemical Factories All living things are made up of billions of tiny cells, just as a building is made of bricks. Cells are the building blocks of life. They are the simplest structural and functional units of life.What do you think cells do? To answer this question, you need to imagine your cells as chemical factories. Many chemical reactions occur continually inside these factories to keep you alive. For example:• A cell takes in raw materials. • Then, it processes these materials to make new molecules.• These molecules can either be used by the cell itself or transported to other parts of the body. In any factory, there are different departments that carry out different functions. A cell also has different structures that perform different roles within the cell. For example, mitochondria provide energy for cell activities, and chloroplasts carry out photosynthesis. Such division of labour increases efficiency within the system. It ensures that the cell can survive and perform its role within the body. How Did Cells Get Their Name? The term ‘cells’ was first introduced by an English scientist, Robert Hooke, in 1667.He used one of the earliest microscopes to examine thin slices of cork from the barkof a tree (Figure 1.1). Hooke saw closely packed little boxes with thick walls. He named the boxes ‘cells’, just like the cells in a honeycomb or a prison. In fact, Hooke only saw the walls of dead plant cells.  1.1 What Are Cells? Learning Outcomes• Identify and state the functions of the following cell structures (including organelles) of typical plant and animal cells from diagrams, light micrographs and as seen under the light microscope using prepared slides and fresh material treated with an appropriate temporary staining technique: cell wall, cell membrane, cytoplasm, nucleus, cell vacuoles (large, sap-filled in plant cells, small, temporary in animal cells), chloroplasts.• Identify and state the functions of the following membrane systems and organelles from diagrams and electron micrographs: endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi body, mitochondria, ribosomes.• Compare the structure of typical animal and plant cells.

This helps us to build up a three-dimensional picture of the cell.Figure 1.2 Microscopes How Can We Study the Parts of the Cell?Most cells are too small to be seen with our eyes alone. We can use light and electron microscopes to help us to see cells and their parts.

These pictures are called micrographs.• Light micrographscan come out as colour images.• Electron micrographsare black-and-white images, but they can be artificially colourised.To get a clearer picture of how a cell is constructed, we may need to make a section of the cell at different planes (Figure 1.3).

But unlike carbohydrates, fats contain much less oxygen in proportion to hydrogen.For example, tristearin (beef fat) has the formula C57H110O6. Note how little oxygen it contains in proportion to hydrogen. The proportions of the elements that make up fats are not fixed, so there is no general formula for fats.Fats can be animal fats or plant fats. Fats are commonly used as a storeof energy, especially by animals.Fats Can Be Broken Down into Fatty Acids and Glycerol Fats can be broken down into simpler compounds such as fatty acids and glycerol. Refer to the general equation shown in Figure 3.16.frozen oil Figure 3.15 The oil on the surface changes from liquid to solid when placed in the refrigerator. The reaction involves an enzyme. For example, when tristearin is broken down by the enzyme lipase, stearic acid and glycerol are produced: three stearic acid molecules(an example of fatty acid)lipase tristearin glycerol+Figure 3.16 A fat molecule breaks down into glycerol and fatty acid. Biological MoleculesChapter 3 49What Are the Sources of Fats?• Foods that are rich in fats include butter, cheese, fatty meat, olives, many nuts, peas, beans, seeds of castor oil and palm oil (Figure 3.17).• The meat of most fishes and ‘white meats’ have relatively less fats. However, some fishes such as herring and salmon have lots of fats. Figure 3.18 Seals and polar bears have a thick layer of fat beneath their skin, which helps reduce heat loss.What Are the Functions of Fats?How are some animals able to survive in cold climate, while others are not able to? What are the features common to these animals? How do these features help them to survive in the cold? Fats function as:• A source and a long-term storage of energy.– They are a suitable long-term storage material because fats have a higher energy value compared to carbohydrates.• An insulating material that prevents excessive heat loss. For example, animals such as seals have a thick layer of fat (blubber) beneath the skin, which helps to reduce loss of body heat (Figure 3.18).• A solvent for fat-soluble vitamins and many other vital substances such as hormones.• An essential part of cells, especially in cell membranes. • A way to reduce water loss from the skin surface. Glands in the skin secrete an oily substance.– This oily substance forms a thin layer over the skin surface, reducing the rate of evaporation of water.– The oily substance also reduces the rate of heat loss from the skin.

To find the surface area of a cube, find the area of one face and multiply by six. From our calculations, we can observe that as the cube becomes bigger, the surface area does not increase in the same proportion as the volume. The cube of sides 1 cm has 6 cm2of surface area to 1 cm3volume. But the cube of sides 3 cm has only 2 cm2of surface area to 1 cm3volume. The largest cube has the smallest surface area-to-volume ratio. The rate of movement of substances across the largest cube is the slowest. Thus, as a cell grows, the rate of movement of substances across a cell will decrease. Surface Area-to-volume RatioWhat does surface area-to-volume ratio mean to a cell?Why are cells typically small? Why do all large organisms always have bodies made up of many small cells and not just one large cell?The answers to these questions are related to the rate at which materials move across the cell membrane. Cells need to move oxygen, nutrients and waste materials across their cell membrane fast enough to stay alive. The rate of movement of a substance across a cell membrane depends on how large the cell membrane is (i.e. the surface area of the cell). For two cells of the same volume, the one with the larger surface area allows for a higher rate of diffusion. The ratio between the surface area and volume of a cell is called surface area-to-volume ratio, and is an essential concept in biology. The greater the surface area-to-volume ratio of a cell, the higher the rate at which substances move in and out of it. The following investigation will help you better understand surface area-to-volume ratios. 25Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 Let’s explore the efficiency of diffusion in three types of cells using the models in Figure 2.7.In Figure 2.7, the larger cell B has more surface area than cell A, but it has less surface area for every unit volume of protoplasm compared to A. The rate of intake of food and oxygen per unit volume is therefore slower in cell\xa0B than in cell A. The cells in root tips and shoot tips are small and actively growing. As a cell continues to grow in size, its growth slows down and stops once it reaches its optimumsize. This is because as the cell grows larger, the rate of oxygen and food intake slows down. Thus, it will not be beneficial for a cell to grow too big. Cell C with sides of 3 cmPortion Z has as an even smaller surface area per unit volume. Therefore, it gets less food and oxygen per unit time compared to Y. The whole cell C is even less active than the other two cells.Cell A with sides of 1 cmThis cell can obtain food and oxygen from all its sides.Cell B with sides of 2 cmPortion Y has the same volume of protoplasm as X. However, its surface area has been reduced by half. It can only obtain half the amount of food and oxygen per unit time compared to X. Thus, the whole cell B can only be half as active as cell A.Figure 2.7 Models to explain what surface area-to-volume ratio means to a cell of increasing size Each shaded square represents the surface area of a unit volume of protoplasm.food and oxygen in waste products out imaginary lines Word AlertOptimum:best or most favourable How do cells adapt their surface area-to-volume ratios?Consider the two shapes in Figure 2.8.

Placing an animal cell in a solution with lower water potential will cause it to lose water. The cell shrinks and spikes appear on the cell (Figure 2.23). This process is called crenation. An animal cell will become dehydrated and eventually die when placed in a solution with a low water potential.

The young stems and leaves of herbaceous and non-woody plants are able to remain firm and erect. This is because of the turgor pressure within their cells. When there is a high rate of water loss from the cells, they lose their turgidity and the plant wilts. The movements of certain plant parts are due to changes in turgor. For example, changes in the turgor of the guard cells cause the opening and closing of the stomata (Figure 2.24). Plasmolysis causes cells to become flaccid or limp (Figure 2.25). Cells will be killed if they remain plasmolysed for too long. Thus, it is not advisable to add too much fertiliser around the roots of plants because the soil solution will become very concentrated and water molecules will move out of the roots by osmosis. Inability of the roots to absorb water, together with continued evaporation of water from the leaves, will cause the plant to wilt. Unless sufficient water is added to dilute the soil solution, the plant will eventually die (Figure 2.26).Helpful Note Soil solution is a thin film of water that surrounds individual soil particles. It usually contains dissolved mineral salts or ions.

Document 14: 30 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 How Does Osmosis Affect Living Organisms?A cell is surrounded by a living, partially permeable cell membrane. Enclosed within the cell membrane are the nucleus, cytoplasm and a mixture of various substances.Note that the cell wall of plants is permeable and allows most dissolved substances to pass through. A plant cell behaves differently from an animal cell when placed in solutions with differing water potentials. This is due to the presence of the cell wall in plant cells.TechConnectIn Singapore, there are five NEWater plants that supply Singapore with up to 40% of its water needs. The NEWater process involves recycling treated used water into ultra-clean, high-grade reclaimed water. One of the stages of the NEWater production process is reverse osmosis. Similar to osmosis, this process involves a partially permeable membrane. However, pressure is applied to move water molecules across the membrane in a direction that is opposite to that of osmosis.Reverse osmosis can remove toxins from water. By this method, very small particles can be removed by using an electric pump to force water under high pressure through a membrane (Figure 2.19). The membrane is partially permeable and has very tiny pores, which allow only very small molecules such as water molecules to pass through. The water is passed through the membrane several times until pure water is obtained.Why do you think NEWater is an important source of water for Singapore? Figure 2.19 Reverse osmosis water treatment systemFigure 2.18 represents graphically how water potential is associated with osmosis. Figure 2.18 Graphical representation of water potential gradient Osmosisis the net movement of water molecules from a region of higher water potential to a region of lower water potential, through a partially permeable membrane. Similar to diffusion, the rate of osmosis can be affected by factors such as:• water potential gradient • distance over which water molecules need to move • surface area-to-volume ratio 31 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 What Happens to a Cell in a Solution With Higher Water Potential? When a cell is placed in a solution with a higher water potential, water molecules will move from a region of higher water potential (outside the cell), into a region of lower water potential (inside the cell).A plant cell will expand or swell. This is because plant cells are protected by an inelastic cell wall (Figure 2.20). Plants are supported by the pressure of water inside the cells pressing outwards on the cell wall. An animal cell will swell and may even burst in a solution of higher water potential than its cytoplasm (Figure 2.21). This is because, unlike plants, it does not have a cell wall to protect it. What Happens to a Cell in a Solution of the Same Water Potential?Cells immersed in a solution with the same water potential as their cytoplasm will not change their size or shape. The movement of water molecules is the same in both directions. Hence, there is no net movement of water molecules in or out of the cell.Figure 2.20 A plant cell in a solution with higher water potential Figure 2.21 An animal cell in a solution with higher water potentialHomeostasis, Co-ordination and ResponseThrough the processes of diffusion, osmosis and active transport, the internal environments of living organisms are kept constant to provide the optimal conditions for cells to survive.Disciplinary Idea placed in a solution of higher water potentialAs water molecules enter the cell, the vacuole increases in size and pushes the cytoplasm against the cell wall. The cell does not burst because it is protected by the inelastic cell wall. The turgidity of the cell with water is called turgor. The pressure exerted by the water in the vacuole is the turgor pressure. 4 The cell expands or swells. The cell is said to become turgid. 3 When a plant cell is placed in a solution of higher water potential, the cell sap has lower water potential than that of the solution outside the cell. 1plant cell cell sap in vacuole By osmosis, water molecules enter the cell through the partially permeable cell membrane. 2LinkHuman cells must be surrounded by fluid in relatively constant water potential.

Document 13: 28 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 ChemistryWe learn that the concentration of a solution is given by the amount of a solute dissolved in a unit volume of the solution. Link Compared to arm B, arm A contains: • More sucrose molecules per unit volume• Fewer water molecules per unit volumeAfter some time, the level of solution in arm A rises, while that in arm B falls.What do you think has happened?• Sucrose molecules cannot diffuse from arm A to B because the molecules are too big to pass through the pores of the membrane. • Water molecules move from B to A because solution B has more water molecules per unit volume than solution A. A dilute solution has more water molecules per unit volume than a concentrated solution of the same volume.Net result: Both arms A and B have the same solute concentration (same number of solute molecules per unit volume).The diffusion of water molecules across a partially permeable membrane is called osmosis. 2.2 What Is Osmosis?Learning Outcomes• Define osmosis, investigate and describe the effects of osmosis on plant and animal tissues.• Discuss the factors that affect the rate of osmosis. Figure 2.15 Experimental set-up to demonstrate osmosis OsmosisThe cell membrane is a partially permeable membrane. It allows some substances to pass through but not others.

Mark the level on the outside of the boiling tube.5Set up a second experiment in a similar way but with distilled water in both the dialysis tubing and the boiling tube. 6After 20 minutes, observe and note the level of liquid inside and outside the tubing in each experiment. Observation and Discussion1What can you say about the dialysis tubing? How do you account for your observation in step 6?2What is the purpose of the second experimental set-up? Let’s Investigate 2.4 What Is Water Potential and How Is It Related to Osmosis?• The term ‘water potential’ is always used in connection with osmosis. Water potential is a measure of the tendency of water molecules to move from one place to another. A dilute solution (solution with lower concentration of solute) would have a higher water potential than a concentrated solution. Hence, water molecules would move out of the dilute solution and into the concentrated solution through osmosis.• When a partially permeable membrane separates two solutions of different water potentials, a water potential gradient is established (Figure 2.17). Water molecules move from a region with higher water potential to a region with a lower one, that is, down a water potential gradient.

A complex carbohydrate is made up of many similar molecules of single sugar joined together to form a large molecule. Starch, glycogen and cellulose are complex carbohydrates made up of numerous glucose molecules. The glucose molecules are linked in different ways, giving rise to different structures. Hence, starch, glycogen and cellulose have different chemical and biological properties. They also have different roles as shown in Table 3.3. TechConnectFibre is found in vegetables and fruits. Fibre cannot be digested and we often find food high in fibre difficult to chew. This poses a problem for the elderly, who may not be able to chew food effectively. Enter the technology of soluble fibre supplements! Engineers have applied their knowledge of what roughage can do for our digestive system. They also understand how roughage can exist as fibres that are soluble in water. The result of this is a powdery substance that we can dissolve in water, or even mix with food or with soup and drink down (Figure 3.11). Some supplements are tasteless and odourless, which makes them highly suitable for the taste-conscious consumer. This is a good example of how engineers create a piece of technology out of what was originally a solution to a problem. The technology comes in the form of an industrial product that is available to the average consumer.

Document 13: 28 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 ChemistryWe learn that the concentration of a solution is given by the amount of a solute dissolved in a unit volume of the solution. Link Compared to arm B, arm A contains: • More sucrose molecules per unit volume• Fewer water molecules per unit volumeAfter some time, the level of solution in arm A rises, while that in arm B falls.What do you think has happened?• Sucrose molecules cannot diffuse from arm A to B because the molecules are too big to pass through the pores of the membrane. • Water molecules move from B to A because solution B has more water molecules per unit volume than solution A. A dilute solution has more water molecules per unit volume than a concentrated solution of the same volume.Net result: Both arms A and B have the same solute concentration (same number of solute molecules per unit volume).The diffusion of water molecules across a partially permeable membrane is called osmosis. 2.2 What Is Osmosis?Learning Outcomes• Define osmosis, investigate and describe the effects of osmosis on plant and animal tissues.• Discuss the factors that affect the rate of osmosis. Figure 2.15 Experimental set-up to demonstrate osmosis OsmosisThe cell membrane is a partially permeable membrane. It allows some substances to pass through but not others. Figure 2.15 shows the two arms of a U-tube separated by a partially permeable membrane. This membrane is permeable to water molecules but not to sucrose molecules. Sucrose is cane sugar, also known as table sugar. 29 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 Figure 2.17 Water potential gradient set up in the container AimTo demonstrate osmosisProcedure1Tie a knot at one end of a piece of dialysis tubing.2Half-fill a boiling tube with distilled water.3Use a pipette to half-fill the dialysis tubing with sucrose solution. Carefully rinse the outside of the dialysis tubing with distilled water if any sucrose solution is spilled.4Set up the apparatus as shown in Figure 2.16. Make sure the levels of the liquid inside and outside the tubing are the same. Use a paper clip to hold the dialysis tubing in place. Mark the level on the outside of the boiling tube.5Set up a second experiment in a similar way but with distilled water in both the dialysis tubing and the boiling tube. 6After 20 minutes, observe and note the level of liquid inside and outside the tubing in each experiment. Observation and Discussion1What can you say about the dialysis tubing? How do you account for your observation in step 6?2What is the purpose of the second experimental set-up? Let’s Investigate 2.4 What Is Water Potential and How Is It Related to Osmosis?• The term ‘water potential’ is always used in connection with osmosis. Water potential is a measure of the tendency of water molecules to move from one place to another. A dilute solution (solution with lower concentration of solute) would have a higher water potential than a concentrated solution. Hence, water molecules would move out of the dilute solution and into the concentrated solution through osmosis.• When a partially permeable membrane separates two solutions of different water potentials, a water potential gradient is established (Figure 2.17). Water molecules move from a region with higher water potential to a region with a lower one, that is, down a water potential gradient.

Document 14: 30 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 How Does Osmosis Affect Living Organisms?A cell is surrounded by a living, partially permeable cell membrane. Enclosed within the cell membrane are the nucleus, cytoplasm and a mixture of various substances.Note that the cell wall of plants is permeable and allows most dissolved substances to pass through. A plant cell behaves differently from an animal cell when placed in solutions with differing water potentials. This is due to the presence of the cell wall in plant cells.TechConnectIn Singapore, there are five NEWater plants that supply Singapore with up to 40% of its water needs. The NEWater process involves recycling treated used water into ultra-clean, high-grade reclaimed water. One of the stages of the NEWater production process is reverse osmosis. Similar to osmosis, this process involves a partially permeable membrane. However, pressure is applied to move water molecules across the membrane in a direction that is opposite to that of osmosis.Reverse osmosis can remove toxins from water. By this method, very small particles can be removed by using an electric pump to force water under high pressure through a membrane (Figure 2.19). The membrane is partially permeable and has very tiny pores, which allow only very small molecules such as water molecules to pass through. The water is passed through the membrane several times until pure water is obtained.Why do you think NEWater is an important source of water for Singapore? Figure 2.19 Reverse osmosis water treatment systemFigure 2.18 represents graphically how water potential is associated with osmosis. Figure 2.18 Graphical representation of water potential gradient Osmosisis the net movement of water molecules from a region of higher water potential to a region of lower water potential, through a partially permeable membrane. Similar to diffusion, the rate of osmosis can be affected by factors such as:• water potential gradient • distance over which water molecules need to move • surface area-to-volume ratio 31 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 What Happens to a Cell in a Solution With Higher Water Potential? When a cell is placed in a solution with a higher water potential, water molecules will move from a region of higher water potential (outside the cell), into a region of lower water potential (inside the cell).A plant cell will expand or swell. This is because plant cells are protected by an inelastic cell wall (Figure 2.20). Plants are supported by the pressure of water inside the cells pressing outwards on the cell wall. An animal cell will swell and may even burst in a solution of higher water potential than its cytoplasm (Figure 2.21). This is because, unlike plants, it does not have a cell wall to protect it. What Happens to a Cell in a Solution of the Same Water Potential?Cells immersed in a solution with the same water potential as their cytoplasm will not change their size or shape. The movement of water molecules is the same in both directions. Hence, there is no net movement of water molecules in or out of the cell.Figure 2.20 A plant cell in a solution with higher water potential Figure 2.21 An animal cell in a solution with higher water potentialHomeostasis, Co-ordination and ResponseThrough the processes of diffusion, osmosis and active transport, the internal environments of living organisms are kept constant to provide the optimal conditions for cells to survive.Disciplinary Idea placed in a solution of higher water potentialAs water molecules enter the cell, the vacuole increases in size and pushes the cytoplasm against the cell wall. The cell does not burst because it is protected by the inelastic cell wall. The turgidity of the cell with water is called turgor. The pressure exerted by the water in the vacuole is the turgor pressure. 4 The cell expands or swells. The cell is said to become turgid. 3 When a plant cell is placed in a solution of higher water potential, the cell sap has lower water potential than that of the solution outside the cell. 1plant cell cell sap in vacuole By osmosis, water molecules enter the cell through the partially permeable cell membrane. 2LinkHuman cells must be surrounded by fluid in relatively constant water potential.

Can you clarify what the function of mitochondria in a cell is?","Mitochondria are small oval or sausage-shaped organelles where aerobic respiration occurs. During aerobic respiration, food substances are broken down to release energy. This energy may be used by the cell to perform cell activities such as growth and reproduction.","Document 1: 4 Chapter 1 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeCell Structure and OrganisationChapter 1 Figure 1.5 A generalised plant cell The protoplasm of a cell is made up of three parts: the cell membrane(also known as cell surface membrane), cytoplasmand nucleus(Figure 1.4). Cell MembraneThe cell membrane surrounds the cytoplasm of the cell. The cell membrane is made up of lipidsand proteins. It is a partially permeable membrane. This means that it allows only some substances to pass through it. Hence, the cell membrane controls the movement of substances in and out of the cell. Cell WallA plant cell also has a cell wallthat encloses the entire plant cell, surrounding the cell membrane (Figure 1.5). This cell wall is made of cellulose. It protects the cell from injury and gives the plant cell a fixed shape. The cell wall is fully permeable, so it does not control the type of substances that enter or leave the cell. The cell wall is absent in animal cells. Figure 1.4 A generalised animal cell showing some major organelles SystemsCells are highly organised biological systems with many organelles. While each organelle performs specific functions, the various organelles work as a co-ordinated system within the cell to carry out processes needed to sustain life.

Organelles inside the cell are also enclosed by their own membranes. Word AlertMitochodrion:singular for mitochondriaLipids:biological molecules that are not soluble in water. Examples of lipids are fats, waxes and oils. 5 Chapter 1 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeCell Structure and OrganisationChapter 1 CytoplasmThe cytoplasm is a jelly-like substance that fills the inside of the cell and is enclosed by the cell membrane. It is the part of the protoplasm between the cell membrane and the nucleus. It is where most cell activities occur. The cytoplasm contains organelles. An organelleis a cellular structure that performs a specific job within a cell.Organelles carry out many functions in the cell. You will learn more about them in later parts of this chapter. Many organelles, such as mitochondria, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi bodyand ribosomesare not visible under the light microscope. They can only be studied under the electron microscope. What Are the Parts of the Cytoplasm?The cytoplasm contains tiny structures called organelles (Figure 1.6). Each organelleis specialised for a particular function. Examples of these organelles are nucleus, rough endoplasmic reticulum, ribosomes, Golgi body, mitochondria, chloroplasts and vacuoles.  Figure 1.6 Organelles in an animal cell seen under an electron microscope NucleusThe nucleus is surrounded by a membrane called the nuclear membrane. The nucleus contains genetic information in the form of chromosomes. You will learn more about chromosomes later in this section. These are the functions of the nucleus:• It controls cell activities such as cell growth and the repair of worn-out parts.• It is essential for cell division. Cells without a nucleus, like the red blood cells of a mammal, are unable to divide.

Cells are the building blocks of life. They are the simplest structural and functional units of life.What do you think cells do? To answer this question, you need to imagine your cells as chemical factories. Many chemical reactions occur continually inside these factories to keep you alive. For example:• A cell takes in raw materials. • Then, it processes these materials to make new molecules.• These molecules can either be used by the cell itself or transported to other parts of the body. In any factory, there are different departments that carry out different functions. A cell also has different structures that perform different roles within the cell. For example, mitochondria provide energy for cell activities, and chloroplasts carry out photosynthesis. Such division of labour increases efficiency within the system. It ensures that the cell can survive and perform its role within the body. How Did Cells Get Their Name? The term ‘cells’ was first introduced by an English scientist, Robert Hooke, in 1667.He used one of the earliest microscopes to examine thin slices of cork from the barkof a tree (Figure 1.1). Hooke saw closely packed little boxes with thick walls. He named the boxes ‘cells’, just like the cells in a honeycomb or a prison. In fact, Hooke only saw the walls of dead plant cells.  1.1 What Are Cells? Learning Outcomes• Identify and state the functions of the following cell structures (including organelles) of typical plant and animal cells from diagrams, light micrographs and as seen under the light microscope using prepared slides and fresh material treated with an appropriate temporary staining technique: cell wall, cell membrane, cytoplasm, nucleus, cell vacuoles (large, sap-filled in plant cells, small, temporary in animal cells), chloroplasts.• Identify and state the functions of the following membrane systems and organelles from diagrams and electron micrographs: endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi body, mitochondria, ribosomes.• Compare the structure of typical animal and plant cells. Figure 1.1 Robert Hooke observed that cork is made up of tiny cells.  3 Chapter 1 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeCell Structure and OrganisationChapter 1 Figure 1.3 We may cut a cell in two different ways in order to view cell structures from different angles. This helps us to build up a three-dimensional picture of the cell.Figure 1.2 Microscopes How Can We Study the Parts of the Cell?Most cells are too small to be seen with our eyes alone. We can use light and electron microscopes to help us to see cells and their parts. Over 300 years ago, biologists like Robert Hooke and Antonie van Leeuwenhoek created their own light microscopes to study microscopic objects!• Light microscopesmagnify objects up to 1000x (spoken: one thousand times) (Figure 1.2(a)). • Electron microscopesmagnify objects to more than 200 000x (spoken: two hundred thousand times)(Figure 1.2(b)).A camera can be fitted to either type of microscope to take pictures. These pictures are called micrographs.• Light micrographscan come out as colour images.• Electron micrographsare black-and-white images, but they can be artificially colourised.To get a clearer picture of how a cell is constructed, we may need to make a section of the cell at different planes (Figure 1.3).

"As a biology student trying to grasp the intricacies of enzymes and their role in cellular processes, could you explain how temperature variations impact the rate of enzyme reactions?","An enzyme is less active at low temperatures. As the temperature increases, the rate of enzyme reaction also increases. There is an optimum temperature, where the enzyme is most active. For most human enzymes, the optimum temperature is about 40–45 °C. Increasing the temperature above the optimum causes a rapid decrease in the rate of enzyme reaction. At very high temperatures, the enzyme molecules are denatured and lose their active sites, hence they can no longer act as a catalyst.","Document 31: 64 Chapter 4 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeEnzymesChapter 4 An enzyme is specific in its action due to its three-dimensional shape. The ‘lock-and-key’ hypothesis explains how the shape of an enzyme affects the way it functions. ‘Lock-and-key’ Hypothesis The substances on which enzymes act are called substrates. For example, protein is the substrate on which a protease acts. According to the ‘lock-and-key’ hypothesis, enzyme reactions depend on the presence of active sites (Figure 4.8). Active sites are grooves (depressions) or ‘pockets’ on the surface of an enzyme molecule into which the substrate molecule(s) with the matching shape can fit — just like a lock and key. The enzyme is the lock, and the substrate is the key.  When the substrate binds to the active site of the enzyme, anenzyme–substrate complex is formed. It is a temporary molecule formed when substrates bind to the enzyme. Reactions take place at the active site to convert the substrate molecule(s) into product molecule(s). The product molecule(s) separate(s) from the enzyme. The enzyme molecule remains unchanged and is free to combine again with more substrate molecules. The general equation is: E + S ES E + P where E= enzymeS= substrate(s)P= product(s). Figure 4.8 Three-dimensional model of enzyme pepsin with its active siteactive site (groove on the protein)Structure and FunctionThe structure of biological molecules affects their functions. For example, the structure of enzymes affects the substrates that can fit into the active site. This affects the reactions they catalyse.Disciplinary Idea 65 Chapter 4 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeEnzymesChapter 4 Word AlertComplementary:matching An enzyme has a specific three-dimensional (3-D) shape. It has a depression called the active site. The substance on which the enzyme acts is called the substrate. Later, the products leave the active site. The enzyme remains unchanged. It can catalyse another reaction.While the substrate is attached to the active site, a chemical reaction occurs. The substrate is converted to the products.Only the substrate with a 3-D shape complementaryto that of the active site can fit into the enzyme. This results in the formation of an enzyme–substrate complex. The enzyme is just like a lock and the substrate a key. The substrate fits into the enzyme just like a key fits into a lock. This is called the ‘lock-and-key’ hypothesis. 1 3 4  Figure 4.9 The mode of action of an enzyme The specific nature of an enzyme for its substrate is described in Figure 4.9. 2 Substrate entering active site of enzyme Substrate binds to active site of enzyme Chemical reaction occurs while substrate is attached to the enzyme Products leaving active site of enzyme

Document 32: 66 Chapter 4 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeEnzymesChapter 4 Characteristics of EnzymesEnzymes Speed Up Chemical ReactionsEnzymes alter the rates of chemical reactions that occur in a cell. Enzymes speed up a chemical reaction by lowering the activation energy needed to start the reaction.Enzymes Are Specific in Action Enzymes have active sites. Only substrates with a shape complementary to the active site can fit into the enzymes. When an enzyme binds to its substrate, it forms an enzyme–substrate complex. However, high temperature, acids and alkalis can affect the shape of an enzyme and consequently its function.Enzymes Are Required in Minute Amounts and RemainUnchanged at the End of ReactionsEnzymes are very efficient molecules. Since they remain unchanged in the reactions they catalyse, the same enzyme molecules can be used over and over again. Thus, a small amount of an enzyme can catalyse the reaction for a large amount of substrate. For example, just a spoonful of washing powder containing enzymes is enough to wash a large load of clothing. Enzymes Are Affected by TemperatureFigure 4.10 shows the effect of temperature on the rate of enzyme reaction. Figure 4.10 Effect of temperature on the rate of enzyme reaction  Word AlertOptimum:most favourable  An enzyme is less active at low temperatures.At low temperature, the kinetic energy of molecules is low. Enzyme and substrate molecules move slowly. The rate of the substrate molecules colliding with the enzyme is very low. 1As the temperature increases, the rate of enzyme reaction increases.Increasing the temperature increases the kinetic energy of molecules. The rate of effective collision (i.e. the rate of substrate molecules colliding and fitting into the active site of the enzyme) is increased. This increases the rate of enzyme-substrate complex formation. 2This is the optimum temperature, where the enzymeis most active. For most human enzymes, the optimumtemperature is about 40–45 °C. 367 Chapter 4 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeEnzymesChapter 4 Increasing the temperature above the optimum causes a rapid decrease in the rate of enzyme reaction. The active site of the enzyme molecule begins to lose its original shape and is no longer complementary to the shape of substrate molecules.  4At this temperature all the enzyme molecules have been denatured. Most enzymes are denatured. 5 Denaturation results in the loss or alteration of the enzyme’s active site(Figure 4.11). The substrate can no longer fit into the enzyme’s active site, and no reaction will occur. Hence, when an enzyme is denatured, it can no longer act as a catalyst. Denaturation is the change in the three-dimensional structure of an enzyme or any other soluble protein, caused by heat or chemicals such as acids or alkalis. Figure 4.11 At temperatures above optimum, some enzymes are denatured. Enzymes lose their active sites when they are denatured.

Learning Outcomes• Identify and state the functions of the following cell structures (including organelles) of typical plant and animal cells from diagrams, light micrographs and as seen under the light microscope using prepared slides and fresh material treated with an appropriate temporary staining technique: cell wall, cell membrane, cytoplasm, nucleus, cell vacuoles (large, sap-filled in plant cells, small, temporary in animal cells), chloroplasts.• Identify and state the functions of the following membrane systems and organelles from diagrams and electron micrographs: endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi body, mitochondria, ribosomes.• Compare the structure of typical animal and plant cells. Figure 1.1 Robert Hooke observed that cork is made up of tiny cells.  3 Chapter 1 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeCell Structure and OrganisationChapter 1 Figure 1.3 We may cut a cell in two different ways in order to view cell structures from different angles. This helps us to build up a three-dimensional picture of the cell.Figure 1.2 Microscopes How Can We Study the Parts of the Cell?Most cells are too small to be seen with our eyes alone. We can use light and electron microscopes to help us to see cells and their parts. Over 300 years ago, biologists like Robert Hooke and Antonie van Leeuwenhoek created their own light microscopes to study microscopic objects!• Light microscopesmagnify objects up to 1000x (spoken: one thousand times) (Figure 1.2(a)). • Electron microscopesmagnify objects to more than 200 000x (spoken: two hundred thousand times)(Figure 1.2(b)).A camera can be fitted to either type of microscope to take pictures. These pictures are called micrographs.• Light micrographscan come out as colour images.• Electron micrographsare black-and-white images, but they can be artificially colourised.To get a clearer picture of how a cell is constructed, we may need to make a section of the cell at different planes (Figure 1.3).

A cellis a unit of life. It consists of a mass of living matter called protoplasm.While all the cells of your body may not look the same, they all have similar parts. Each living cell consists of living material called protoplasm(Greek: protos= first; plasm= form). Protoplasm is a complex jelly-like substance.

What is the definition of diffusion and how does it differ from active transport?,"Diffusion is the net movement of particles (atoms, molecules or ions) from a region where they are of higher concentration to a region where they are of lower concentration, that is, down a concentration gradient. On the other hand, active transport is the process in which energy is used to move the particles of a substance across a membrane against its concentration gradient, that is, from a region where the particles are of lower concentration to a region where they are of higher concentration.","Document 9: 20 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 2.1 What Is Diffusion? Learning Outcomes• Define diffusion and describe its role in nutrient uptake and gaseous exchange in plants and humans. • Describe the factors that affect the rate of diffusion. DiffusionImagine that you are sitting in the living room reading a book. Your sister accidentally spills a bottle of perfume in the living room. Gradually, you become aware of a pleasant scent spreading through the living room.Figure 2.1 illustrates how diffusion takes place. Figure 2.1 Diffusion of perfume particlesPerfume, like all matter, is made up of particles such as atoms, molecules or ions.Individual particles of perfume evaporate from the surface of the spill, that is, they become a gas.The gas particles have kinetic energy and are constantly moving in all directions. They bump into one another and move about randomly.This causes the gas to spread throughout the house, until it reaches your nose and you smell it. The gas spreads outwards through a process called diffusion.What Is a Concentration Gradient and How Is It Related to Diffusion?In Figure 2.1, point A represents the location where the bottle of perfume was spilled. Point B represents you in the living room, some distance away. Concentration refers to the amount of a substance within a fixed volume. The concentration of gas particles is higher at A than at B. Thus, there is a difference in concentration between points A and B. This concentration difference can be shown on a graph (Figure 2.2) and is referred to as the concentration gradient. 2 4 3 1 PhysicsWe learn that the random movement of microscopic particles is known as Brownian motion.Link 1 2 3 4 AB 21 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 In Figure 2.2, the height of the blue line shows the concentration at each point. If we join the concentrations at A and B, we get a straight line, which is sloped or has a gradient. This red dotted line is the concentration gradientbetween A and B.Concentration gradient is the difference in concentration between two regions.The particles of fluids (liquids and gases) possess movement (kinetic) energy. They are continuously moving about. As their movement is random, the particles will move (diffuse) down the concentration gradient and become evenly spaced out after some time (Figure 2.3). In Figure 2.1, the smell of perfume diffuses throughout the house.• Diffusion can thus be described as the net movement of particles down a concentration gradient.• Thesteeper the concentration gradient for a substance, the faster the rate of diffusion for that substance.Diffusion is the net movement of particles (atoms, molecules or ions) from a region where they are of higher concentration to a region where they are of lower concentration, that is, down a concentration gradient.ChemistryWe learn that all matter is made up of tiny particles that are in constant random motion. These moving particles have kinetic energy. Link Figure 2.2 Graphical representation of diffusion Figure 2.3 Arrows showing direction of movement of particles as they space out  Helpful Note Net movement refers to the overall movement of particles. Net movement of particles occurs when the movement of particles in one direction is greater than the movement of particles in the opposite direction.When the two regions have the same number of particles per unit volume, the movement of the particles between the two regions will be the same in both directions. Thus, there will be no net movement. AimTo investigate the diffusion of a dissolved substance in waterProcedure1Drop a copper(II) sulfate crystal into a gas jar full of water as shown in Figure 2.4. Cover the jar and allow it to stand for a few days.2Observe the changes in the colour of the water.  Let’s Investigate 2.1 Figure 2.4 Experimental set-up to demonstrate diffusion

Document 10: 22 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 Diffusion Across a MembraneFigure 2.5 illustrates the process of diffusion through a permeable membrane. A permeable membrane allows both the solvent (water) and the solutes (the dissolved substances) to pass through it.Eventually, there will be equal concentrations of all particles on both sides of the membrane. Figure 2.5 Diffusion of potassium nitrate and copper(II) sulfate particles through a permeable membrane  Observation and Discussion1Using the concept of concentration gradient, explain why the blue colour of copper(II) sulfate gradually spreads throughout the water in the jar. 2When does diffusion stop?As you saw in Let’s Investigate 2.1, the particles of copper(II) sulfate moved from a region of higher concentration to regions of lower concentration in the surrounding water. In other words, the solute particles diffused evenly throughout the liquid to form a solution.If there is more than one substance dissolved in the same liquid, then the dissolved particles of one substance will diffuse independently of the others.As a result:• The dissolved particles of copper(II) sulfate will diffuse across the membrane to the left side of the beaker.• The dissolved particles of potassium nitrate will diffuse across the membrane to the right side of the beaker.  23 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 Solutes can also diffuse, for example, in the small intestine when dissolved amino acids and glucose are absorbed by diffusion into the blood capillaries. A solute is a substance that has been dissolved in another substance.Figure 2.6 Gas exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide via diffusion SystemsLiving organisms rely on diffusion to facilitate the exchange of gases with the environment needed for survival.Disciplinary Idea Link How do humans carry out gas exchange? Read about it in Chapter 7.How do plants carry out gas exchange? Read about it in Chapter 12. Factors That Affect the Rate of Diffusion The rate of diffusion can be affected by factors such as:• concentration gradient• diffusion distance• surface area-to-volume ratioHow concentration gradient affects the rate of diffusion has been discussed on page 21.Diffusion DistanceThe time taken for a substance to move from one point to another depends on the distance between the two points. The distance through which a substance diffuses is called the diffusion distance. The shorter the diffusion distance, the less time is needed for the substance to travel, and hence the rate of diffusion is higher. In living organisms, the cell membrane is not like the membrane in Figure 2.6. It allows some substances to pass through but not others. For example, oxygen and carbon dioxide can pass through the cell membrane but proteins cannot. Diffusion is an important way by which oxygen and carbon dioxide move into and out of cells. Exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the lungs takes place by diffusion (Figure 2.6(a)). Plant cells such as root hair cells also take in oxygen and remove carbon dioxide by diffusion (Figure 2.6(b)). In both these scenarios, the diffusion distance is short, allowing diffusion to occur at a higher rate.

Document 13: 28 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 ChemistryWe learn that the concentration of a solution is given by the amount of a solute dissolved in a unit volume of the solution. Link Compared to arm B, arm A contains: • More sucrose molecules per unit volume• Fewer water molecules per unit volumeAfter some time, the level of solution in arm A rises, while that in arm B falls.What do you think has happened?• Sucrose molecules cannot diffuse from arm A to B because the molecules are too big to pass through the pores of the membrane. • Water molecules move from B to A because solution B has more water molecules per unit volume than solution A. A dilute solution has more water molecules per unit volume than a concentrated solution of the same volume.Net result: Both arms A and B have the same solute concentration (same number of solute molecules per unit volume).The diffusion of water molecules across a partially permeable membrane is called osmosis. 2.2 What Is Osmosis?Learning Outcomes• Define osmosis, investigate and describe the effects of osmosis on plant and animal tissues.• Discuss the factors that affect the rate of osmosis. Figure 2.15 Experimental set-up to demonstrate osmosis OsmosisThe cell membrane is a partially permeable membrane. It allows some substances to pass through but not others. Figure 2.15 shows the two arms of a U-tube separated by a partially permeable membrane. This membrane is permeable to water molecules but not to sucrose molecules. Sucrose is cane sugar, also known as table sugar. 29 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 Figure 2.17 Water potential gradient set up in the container AimTo demonstrate osmosisProcedure1Tie a knot at one end of a piece of dialysis tubing.2Half-fill a boiling tube with distilled water.3Use a pipette to half-fill the dialysis tubing with sucrose solution. Carefully rinse the outside of the dialysis tubing with distilled water if any sucrose solution is spilled.4Set up the apparatus as shown in Figure 2.16. Make sure the levels of the liquid inside and outside the tubing are the same. Use a paper clip to hold the dialysis tubing in place. Mark the level on the outside of the boiling tube.5Set up a second experiment in a similar way but with distilled water in both the dialysis tubing and the boiling tube. 6After 20 minutes, observe and note the level of liquid inside and outside the tubing in each experiment. Observation and Discussion1What can you say about the dialysis tubing? How do you account for your observation in step 6?2What is the purpose of the second experimental set-up? Let’s Investigate 2.4 What Is Water Potential and How Is It Related to Osmosis?• The term ‘water potential’ is always used in connection with osmosis. Water potential is a measure of the tendency of water molecules to move from one place to another. A dilute solution (solution with lower concentration of solute) would have a higher water potential than a concentrated solution. Hence, water molecules would move out of the dilute solution and into the concentrated solution through osmosis.• When a partially permeable membrane separates two solutions of different water potentials, a water potential gradient is established (Figure 2.17). Water molecules move from a region with higher water potential to a region with a lower one, that is, down a water potential gradient.

Document 17: 36 Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 Figure 2.30 Difference between active transport and diffusion Active transportis the process in which energy is used to move the particles of a substance across a membrane against its concentration gradient, that is, from a region where the particles are of lower concentration to a region where they are of higher concentration.EnergyEnergy is required during active transport to ensure that substances can be transported against a concentration gradient, which is critical for many biological processes.Disciplinary Idea 2.3 What Is Active Transport?Learning Outcome• Define active transportand discuss its importance as an energy-consuming process by which substances are transported against a concentration gradient, as in ion uptake by root hairs and uptake of glucose by cells in the villi. Living cells are able to absorb certain substances even though these substances are of higher concentration inside the cell than they are in the external environment. This means that the cells are absorbing substances against a concentration gradient (Figure 2.30). Such a process requires energy and is called active transport. 1Humans store food to see them through times when food is in short supply. Unfortunately, bacteria and fungi attack stored food and make it go bad. One way of preventing this is to store food in strong salt solutions (brine) or sugar solutions (syrups) (Figure 2.29). Suggest with reasons why brine or syrups are used in food preservation.2An animal cell is placed in a concentrated solution of sugar.

It is during respiration that energy is released, and part of this energy is used in active transport.In the human body, examples of active transport include the uptake of glucose by the microvilli of epithelial cells in the small intestine, and from the kidney tubules into the blood capillaries.In plants, root hair cells can take in mineral salts from the soil solution by diffusion or active transport, depending on the concentration of mineral salts in the soil solution (Figure 2.31).

What is the effect of the former on the latter?,"The rate of movement of a substance across a cell membrane depends on how large the cell membrane is (i.e. the surface area of the cell). For two cells of the same volume, the one with the larger surface area allows for a higher rate of diffusion. The ratio between the surface area and volume of a cell is called surface area-to-volume ratio, and is an essential concept in biology. The greater the surface area-to-volume ratio of a cell, the higher the rate at which substances move in and out of it.","Document 11: 24Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 Let’s Investigate 2.2Calculating Surface Area-to-volume Ratios1Consider three cubes of sides 1 cm, 2 cm, and 3 cm respectively. We use three cubes to represent cells of different sizes.2Complete Table 2.1. Table 2.1 Surface area-to-volume ratio of three cubes representing cells of different sizesCubesides 1 cm sides 2 cmsides 3 cmSurface areaArea of one face= 1 cm × 1 cm = 1 cm2Surface area= number of faces ×area of one face= 6 × 1 cm2= 6 cm2VolumeVolume= 1 cm × 1 cm × 1 cm= 1 cm3Surface area-to-volume ratio6 cm2: 1 cm3 Helpful Note A cube has six square faces. To find the surface area of a cube, find the area of one face and multiply by six. From our calculations, we can observe that as the cube becomes bigger, the surface area does not increase in the same proportion as the volume. The cube of sides 1 cm has 6 cm2of surface area to 1 cm3volume. But the cube of sides 3 cm has only 2 cm2of surface area to 1 cm3volume. The largest cube has the smallest surface area-to-volume ratio. The rate of movement of substances across the largest cube is the slowest. Thus, as a cell grows, the rate of movement of substances across a cell will decrease. Surface Area-to-volume RatioWhat does surface area-to-volume ratio mean to a cell?Why are cells typically small? Why do all large organisms always have bodies made up of many small cells and not just one large cell?The answers to these questions are related to the rate at which materials move across the cell membrane. Cells need to move oxygen, nutrients and waste materials across their cell membrane fast enough to stay alive. The rate of movement of a substance across a cell membrane depends on how large the cell membrane is (i.e. the surface area of the cell). For two cells of the same volume, the one with the larger surface area allows for a higher rate of diffusion. The ratio between the surface area and volume of a cell is called surface area-to-volume ratio, and is an essential concept in biology. The greater the surface area-to-volume ratio of a cell, the higher the rate at which substances move in and out of it. The following investigation will help you better understand surface area-to-volume ratios. 25Chapter 2 Cells and the Chemistry of LifeMovement of SubstancesChapter 2 Let’s explore the efficiency of diffusion in three types of cells using the models in Figure 2.7.In Figure 2.7, the larger cell B has more surface area than cell A, but it has less surface area for every unit volume of protoplasm compared to A. The rate of intake of food and oxygen per unit volume is therefore slower in cell B than in cell A. The cells in root tips and shoot tips are small and actively growing. As a cell continues to grow in size, its growth slows down and stops once it reaches its optimumsize. This is because as the cell grows larger, the rate of oxygen and food intake slows down. Thus, it will not be beneficial for a cell to grow too big. Cell C with sides of 3 cmPortion Z has as an even smaller surface area per unit volume. Therefore, it gets less food and oxygen per unit time compared to Y. The whole cell C is even less active than the other two cells.Cell A with sides of 1 cmThis cell can obtain food and oxygen from all its sides.Cell B with sides of 2 cmPortion Y has the same volume of protoplasm as X. However, its surface area has been reduced by half. It can only obtain half the amount of food and oxygen per unit time compared to X. Thus, the whole cell B can only be half as active as cell A.Figure 2.7 Models to explain what surface area-to-volume ratio means to a cell of increasing size Each shaded square represents the surface area of a unit volume of protoplasm.food and oxygen in waste products out imaginary lines Word AlertOptimum:best or most favourable How do cells adapt their surface area-to-volume ratios?Consider the two shapes in Figure 2.8.

Could you tell me what the main ones are?,"Fats function as a source and a long-term storage of energy, an insulating material that prevents excessive heat loss, a solvent for fat-soluble vitamins and many other vital substances such as hormones, an essential part of cells, especially in cell membranes, and a way to reduce water loss from the skin surface.","Document 23: 48 Chapter 3 Cells and the Chemistry of Life Have you ever put a bowl or pot of soup in the refrigerator and seen the oil on the surface harden into solids? These are oils or fats (Figure 3.15). Where do they come from, and what does the body do with them? 3.2 What Are Fats?Learning Outcomes• List the chemical elements that make up fats.• State that lipids such as fats are synthesised from glycerol and fatty acids.• State the main roles of fats for insulation and long-term storage of energy in living organisms. • Describe and carry out tests for fats (using ethanol). FatsFats are a type of lipid.Fats, like carbohydrates, are organic molecules made up of the elements carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. But unlike carbohydrates, fats contain much less oxygen in proportion to hydrogen.For example, tristearin (beef fat) has the formula C57H110O6. Note how little oxygen it contains in proportion to hydrogen. The proportions of the elements that make up fats are not fixed, so there is no general formula for fats.Fats can be animal fats or plant fats. Fats are commonly used as a storeof energy, especially by animals.Fats Can Be Broken Down into Fatty Acids and Glycerol Fats can be broken down into simpler compounds such as fatty acids and glycerol. Refer to the general equation shown in Figure 3.16.frozen oil Figure 3.15 The oil on the surface changes from liquid to solid when placed in the refrigerator. The reaction involves an enzyme. For example, when tristearin is broken down by the enzyme lipase, stearic acid and glycerol are produced: three stearic acid molecules(an example of fatty acid)lipase tristearin glycerol+Figure 3.16 A fat molecule breaks down into glycerol and fatty acid. Biological MoleculesChapter 3 49What Are the Sources of Fats?• Foods that are rich in fats include butter, cheese, fatty meat, olives, many nuts, peas, beans, seeds of castor oil and palm oil (Figure 3.17).• The meat of most fishes and ‘white meats’ have relatively less fats. However, some fishes such as herring and salmon have lots of fats. Figure 3.18 Seals and polar bears have a thick layer of fat beneath their skin, which helps reduce heat loss.What Are the Functions of Fats?How are some animals able to survive in cold climate, while others are not able to? What are the features common to these animals? How do these features help them to survive in the cold? Fats function as:• A source and a long-term storage of energy.– They are a suitable long-term storage material because fats have a higher energy value compared to carbohydrates.• An insulating material that prevents excessive heat loss. For example, animals such as seals have a thick layer of fat (blubber) beneath the skin, which helps to reduce loss of body heat (Figure 3.18).• A solvent for fat-soluble vitamins and many other vital substances such as hormones.• An essential part of cells, especially in cell membranes. • A way to reduce water loss from the skin surface. Glands in the skin secrete an oily substance.– This oily substance forms a thin layer over the skin surface, reducing the rate of evaporation of water.– The oily substance also reduces the rate of heat loss from the skin.
