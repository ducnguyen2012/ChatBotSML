question: Why do marathon runners need to eat a lot of carbohydrates before a race, even though eating too much sugary foods can cause obesity?
answer :  Marathon runners need to eat a lot of carbohydrates before a race because they provide energy for their body to function and carry out physical activities. While eating too much sugary foods can lead to obesity, in this case, they are necessary for the release of energy needed for the race.
context: ['What You Will Learn• What are carbohydrates?• What are fats?• What are proteins?Biological Molecules03CHAPTER Do you know that marathon runners need to eat a lot of carbohydrates two days before a race? This may include sugary foods. We know that eating too much sugary foods can cause obesity, sometimes even for people who exercise regularly. Why do you think marathon runners still eat these foods?40  41Biological MoleculesChapter 3 The Need for Food and WaterAll living organisms need food. The food we eat contains nutrients that are essential for us. Nutrients include water, carbohydrates, fats and proteins. Carbohydrates, fats and proteins are three major types of biological molecules found in living organisms. Water is an essential component of all body tissues. About 70% of our body weight is water. Hence, water is extremely important to life.CarbohydratesFigure 3.1 shows food rich in carbohydrates.Carbohydratesare organic molecules made up of the elements carbon, hydrogen and oxygen. The\xa0hydrogen and oxygen atoms are present in the ratio 2 : 1.For example:• glucose has the formula C6H12O6(ratio of hydrogen to oxygenis 12H : 6O = 2H : 1O) • sucrose (cane sugar) has the formula C12H22O11(ratio of hydrogento oxygen is 22H : 11O = 2H : 1O) 3.1 What Are Carbohydrates?Learning Outcomes• List the chemical elements that make up carbohydrates.• State that cellulose, glycogen and starch are synthesised from glucose.• State the main role of carbohydrates as an immediate source of energy in living\xa0organisms. • Describe and carry out tests for starch (using iodine in potassium iodide solution) and reducing sugars (using Benedict’s solution). Figure 3.1 Food rich in carbohydrates Carbohydrates may be classified as single sugars, double sugars or complex carbohydrates (Figure 3.2).  Figure 3.2 Classification of carbohydrates SugarsComplexcarbohydrates:• starch• cellulose• glycogenSingle sugars:• glucose• fructoseDouble sugars:• maltose• sucrose Carbohydrates Helpful Note Water has several important functions. It dissolves substances for chemical reactions that take place in living things. In plants, water is essential for photosynthesis, to keep cells turgid or firm, and to transport mineral salts. In humans, water helps to regulate body temperature and transport dissolved substances within the body. Drinking enough water is important for various body functions.', '42 Chapter 3 Cells and the Chemistry of Life Figure 3.3 Sugars provide us with energy to do sports. SugarsSugars are sweet and soluble in water. When dissolved in water, they will lower the water potential of the solution. Sugars provide us with energy to do work and carry out activities (Figure 3.3). Single SugarsA single sugar is the basic unit of carbohydrate. It can pass through cell membranes and be absorbed into the cells.The common single sugars are glucoseand fructose (refer to Table 3.1). They both have the same chemical formula, C6H12O6, but their atoms are arranged differently within the molecules. These different arrangements give the sugars different chemical and biological properties.Table 3.1 Occurrence of single sugars  Single SugarOccurrenceGlucose Found in plantsand animals Fructose Common in plants,but rare in animals  LinkWhat is water potential? Recall what you have learnt in Chapter 2. 43 Biological MoleculesChapter 3 Link What are enzymes? Read more about them in Chapter 4. Glucose is found in plants and animals. Fructose is common in plants but rare in animals. The structure of glucose and fructose can be represented by the diagrams shown in Figure 3.4.  Figure 3.4 Structures of glucose and fructoseDouble Sugars A double sugar is formed when two single sugars are joined together.Common double sugars are maltoseand sucrose. Maltose (malt sugar) occurs in germinating grains. Maltose consists of two glucose molecules bonded together.The equation below shows how a maltose molecule can be produced from two glucose molecules. A sucrose molecule is made up of one glucose molecule and one fructose molecule joined together.glucose + fructose sucrose The structure of sucrose can be represented in a diagram as shown inFigure 3.5.A double sugar can be split into two single sugar molecules by using an organic molecule called an enzyme. For example, when a solution of maltose is mixed with the enzyme maltase, glucose molecules are produced.  Figure 3.5 Structure of sucrose', '46 Chapter 3 Cells and the Chemistry of Life Glycogen and Starch Are Stores of Glucose Plants store glucose in the form of starch. Animals cannot make or store starch in their bodies. We get most of our carbohydrates from plants in the form of starch. In animals, the main store of glucose is glycogen. Hence, glycogen is sometimes called ‘animal starch’. In mammals, glycogen is stored mainly in the liver and the muscles (Figure 3.12).  Figure 3.12 Glycogen and starch as stores of glucose Figure 3.13 Digestion of starch Glycogen and starch are suitable as storage materials in cells because: • They are insoluble in water, so they do not change the water potential in the cells. • They are large molecules that cannot diffuse through cell membranes, so they will not be lost from the cell. • They can easily be easily broken down to glucose when needed, for example, in tissue respiration. • Their molecules have compact shapes, so they occupy less space than all the individual glucose molecules that make up a glycogen or starch molecule. Breakdown of StarchStarch in the foods we eat may be digested in our alimentary canal. When starch is digested, the bonds within the polysaccharide are broken and the glucose molecules are released.The enzyme amylase digests starch to form the sugar maltose. Amylase cannot break maltose down to glucose. Maltose is hydrolysed to glucose by another enzyme, maltase. Note that complete digestion of starch gives glucose molecules (Figure 3.13).

Carbohydrates are needed:• as a substrate for respiration, to provide energy for cell activities; • to form supporting structures, for example, cell walls in plants; • to be converted into other organic compounds such as amino acids and\xa0fats; • for the formation of nucleic acids, for example, DNA; • to synthesise lubricants, for example, mucus, which consists of a carbohydrate and a protein; and • to synthesise the nectar in some flowers. Nectar is a sweet liquid that plants produce to attract insects. How Can We Test for Starch?Starch can be detected by the iodine test. A few drops of iodine solutionto any substance containing starch will produce a blue-black colour.Link What is respiration? How are carbohydrates involved in the formation of DNA?

Do you agree with what is said here? Why or why not? 1To test a food for presence of reducing sugars or proteins, cut the food into small pieces or grind up the food with a pestle and mortar (Figure 3.25). This helps to break the cells and release the food substances so as to make a concentrated solution for testing.(a)Place some crushed pieces of food in a test-tube. Add\xa02\xa0cm3of water to the test-tube to dissolve the sugars and proteins in the food.(b)Decant the solution into another test-tube. (c)Perform Benedict’s or biuret test with the solution. (Refer toLet's Investigate 3.1 and 3.4 respectively.)2To test for starch, use the iodine test in Let’s Investigate 3.2.3To test for fats, use the ethanol emulsion test in Let’s Investigate 3.3.

They help their clients to incorporate healthy eating behaviours into their lifestyle. To be successful at this, nutrition coaches need to have a good knowledge of what nutrients can do for our health. They must have a good understanding of human behaviour, especially when people are faced with changes in life. They can incorporate healthy diets into the programmes to build the physical fitness of their clients.Cool CareerFigure 3.26 Nutrition coach and a patient discussing a diet plan  54pestle mortar Fats are bad for usand we should not eatany food that contains\xa0fats.In order to obtainenough protein in our diet, we should eat more meat instead of plant-based foods.Since the role ofcarbohydrates is to release energy for our body to function, they are the most important type of nutrient.Figure 3.27 Three friends are having a discussion about nutrients.
